# Blinky

Abstraction around Pacman's repository system.

## Potential Issues

Blinky is built with only the x86_64 architecture in mind, since that is all that Arch Linux officially supports.
If you require support for other architectures, please reach out either in the [issues](https://github.com/BrenekH/blinky/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/BrenekH/blinky/discussions) and we can figure out how to make it work.
